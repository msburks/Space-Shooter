# Space-Shooter

This is my first atttempt at a space shooter in python aracade.

I have attempted to create a game where speed in the name of the game. Kill the enemy spaceships as quickly as possible, and see who can be the fastest! Don't let them hit you or your ship will explode!

Use the directional arrows (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT) on the keyboard to propel the spaceship around in attempt to shoot down the enemy. Fire missiles with the SPACE bar on the keyboard. 

Hope you enjoy!
